      "text": "Initiating Documentary Design\nI'm starting to formulate a basic plan for the nature documentary. Right now, I'm thinking about the audience and broad topic. My next step will be to flesh out the predicted details. I'll need to confirm these elements with you for a more tailored approach.\nRefining Initial Proposals\nI've laid out the plan based on the user's input: a nature documentary targeting a general audience. The video will be approximately 15 seconds long with a cinematic theme, in portrait orientation. The plan also includes an avatar of a male presenter in his 40s dressed as a park ranger, with a deep, calming voice. I'm preparing to present this to the user for feedback.\nCreating Detailed Proposals\nOkay, I've outlined the plan, detailing the topic, audience, music, video length, orientation, script creation, language, avatar, voice, supplemental footage, and captions. I'm formatting it into a table now, ready for you to review. After that, I will directly ask if you are ready to proceed with these predicted details.",

      "text": "Reviewing the Avatar Change\nMy main task is to update the plan, given the user's desire to change the avatar to a female. I'll need to re-evaluate all settings, and then seek final confirmation on the revised approach.\nAdapting the Revised Plan\nI've carefully considered the user's request. My revised plan incorporates the change to a female avatar, keeping the age and attire consistent with the theme, just like before. I've also updated the voice selection to match the new avatar, choosing a warm, calming female voice. The rest of the plan remains the same. The updated plan is ready for confirmation.\nFinalizing the Presentation\nI'm now focusing on presenting the updated plan in its new form. I will show the modified details – the avatar and voice – to the user for review. Then, as usual, I will seek their final confirmation to proceed with creating the video.",
