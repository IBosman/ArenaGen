HeyGen Rebranding POC - LIVE PLAYWRIGHT SESSION! 🎭

✅ NEW: Live Playwright browser - User interacts directly with controlled browser!

Quick Start:
1. npm install
2. npm start (starts both servers)
3. Open http://localhost:3002 (login page)
4. Enter HeyGen credentials
5. Open http://localhost:3000 (control panel)
6. A browser window opens - interact with it directly!

System Architecture:

- Port 3000: Control panel + WebSocket server
- Playwright Browser: Live headed browser (authenticated)

Flow:
1. User logs in at custom UI (port 3002)
2. Playwright authenticates with HeyGen
3. Session cookies saved to heygen-cookies.json
4. Open control panel at port 3000
5. Playwright opens a LIVE browser window
6. User interacts directly with the browser
7. All requests automatically authenticated!

Why Live Playwright?
✅ Real browser window - no proxying needed
✅ Direct interaction - click, type, scroll naturally
✅ No CSP/CORS/worker issues - it's a real browser
✅ Automatic authentication via Playwright context
✅ Custom branding injected via addInitScript
✅ WebSocket control for programmatic navigation
